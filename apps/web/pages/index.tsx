            I'm currently working on a much needed revamp for <b>RepoRank</b>, updating the <b>API</b> and 
            <em>this</em> <b>Client</b>. Which is funny because it's not really a revamp and more just me 
            fixing the <em>entire</em> website because it just broke and I really couldn't be bothered to 
            fix it.
